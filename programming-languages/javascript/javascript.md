- There are nine types:
    - **Undefined**(undefined), used for unintentionally missing values
    - **Null**(null), used for intentionally missing values
    - **Booleans**(true and false), used for logical operators
    - **Numbers**(-100, 100), used for math calculations
    - **Strings**('hello' and "hello"), used for text
    - **Symbols** (uncommon), used to hide implementation details
    - **BigInts**(uncommon and new), used for math on big numbers

- To logout a user using cookies we can use res.clearCookie('key') => this is
  essentially just putting an already expired date as expiration date so the
  browser can remove the cookie.
