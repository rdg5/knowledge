## Handy things to know

- If I need to merge multiple videos recorded with OBS, maybe from a material review, I use the command ```mkvmerge -o foo.mkv bar1.mkv \+ bar2.mkv + bar3.mkv```

- For connecting to my CultureV1 headset I use the following alias ```alias headset="echo -e 'connect 88:A9:A7:DF:FA:B5' | bluetoothctl"```
- For downloading yt videos for whisper analysis I use ```yt-dlp```
