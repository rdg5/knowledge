## Sourdough

### Sourdough starter learnings

	- Tap water needs to be distilled before using it in the starter
 - Rye flour is the best for starters as it contains more lactic acid bacteria than other types of flour [Paper](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/08/190805112156.htm)
 - The best result was yielded by the 100g starter - 50g water 50g rye flour formula. The start should be 100g water 100g rye flour [post](https://kovaszlabor.blog.hu/2018/07/19/igy_neveld_a_kovaszodat)
