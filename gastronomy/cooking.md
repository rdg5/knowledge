# Cooking

- Reducing(sauces, stocks, etc.) is usually accelerating so it starts slow but the speed increases. The pot / pan should be changed frequently

- When cooking stocks, the bones can be reused for a second stock after cooling down

- Stocks can ferment very quickly while hot, so nr1 prio is to cool them down after draining them.
